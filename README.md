Community Issue Reporting System : Developed using Python, Flask, 
HTML, CSS, and MySQL. The application allows users to report and track 
community issues like potholes and broken streetlights. I designed a 
MySQL database and implemented backend logic with Flask for user 
authentication, issue management, and admin functionalities. I created an 
admin dashboard for full control over user and issue management. 
Additionally, I integrated image upload, a categories button for filtering 
issues, and a notification system to keep users informed about their reports. 
The project emphasized secure CRUD operations and scalability.
